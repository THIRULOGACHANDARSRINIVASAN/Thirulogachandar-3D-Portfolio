now clearly ask my requirement in my 3d portfolio i want to build custom toast message using animations how im expecting is if the toast is trigerred it should comes like a rocket starting from right corner at the end of the rocket there is the long cloth attached  in that long cloth the toast message should displaying and the rocket moving from the right top corner to left top corner till the duration ends

Ooo okay 😄 this is a very cool 3D-portfolio-worthy idea, not a normal toast at all. I’m glad you clarified the visual expectation — now it’s crystal clear 🚀🧣

Let me restate your requirement first (to be 100% aligned), then I’ll show how to build it cleanly.

✅ Your exact requirement (in plain words)

When a toast is triggered:

🚀 A rocket appears from the top-right corner

🧣 A long cloth / banner is attached to the rocket tail

📜 The toast message is displayed on that cloth

The rocket moves from right-top → left-top

The movement lasts exactly for the toast duration

When duration ends → rocket + cloth disappear

This is basically a custom animated notification, not a library toast.

🧠 Best tech stack for THIS animation

Since this is a 3D portfolio, the cleanest combo is:

✅ Recommended

React + Tailwind (layout & positioning)

Framer Motion (movement + timing)

SVG or PNG rocket

CSS / SVG for cloth waving

⚠️ Avoid:

react-toastify (too limited)

pure CSS only (painful timing control)

🏗️ Architecture (important)

Instead of “toast”, think:

🎯 AnimatedOverlayNotification

Component structure
RocketToast
 ├── Rocket (image / svg)
 ├── ClothBanner
 │    └── ToastMessage

📐 Positioning logic

Use position: fixed

Start position:

top: -40px

right: -100px

End position:

top: 20px

left: -100% (rocket exits screen)

🎬 Animation concept (Framer Motion)
Rocket movement

Animate x from +100vw → -120vw

Animate y slightly (small wave)

Duration = toast duration

Cloth animation

Cloth stays attached

Add:

slight wave / sway

delayed follow to feel “dragged”

🧩 Core implementation (simplified but real)
1️⃣ RocketToast component
import { motion } from "framer-motion";

export default function RocketToast({ message, duration = 5000 }) {
  return (
    <motion.div
      className="fixed top-6 right-0 z-50 flex items-center"
      initial={{ x: "100vw", y: -20 }}
      animate={{ x: "-120vw" }}
      transition={{
        duration: duration / 1000,
        ease: "linear",
      }}
    >
      {/* Rocket */}
      <img
        src="/rocket.png"
        className="w-16 h-16 rotate-[-15deg]"
        alt="rocket"
      />

      {/* Cloth */}
      <motion.div
        className="ml-2 px-6 py-3 bg-black/80 text-white rounded-r-full shadow-lg whitespace-nowrap"
        animate={{
          y: [0, -3, 3, -2, 2, 0],
        }}
        transition={{
          duration: 1,
          repeat: Infinity,
          ease: "easeInOut",
        }}
      >
        {message}
      </motion.div>
    </motion.div>
  );
}

2️⃣ Triggering the toast

Create a simple toast controller:

const [show, setShow] = useState(false);

const triggerToast = () => {
  setShow(true);
  setTimeout(() => setShow(false), 5000);
};

{show && (
  <RocketToast message="Welcome to my 3D Portfolio 🚀" duration={5000} />
)}

🎨 Make it feel PREMIUM (important tips)
🔥 Rocket realism

Slight rotation (rotate(-15deg))

Tiny flame animation using CSS or SVG

🧣 Cloth realism

Rounded only on right

Add gradient:

background: linear-gradient(to right, #111, #333);

🌀 Extra polish

Smoke particles behind rocket

Sound effect on trigger (optional)

Different messages → different cloth colors

🧠 Why this approach is perfect for a portfolio

✔ Not generic
✔ Shows animation knowledge
✔ Shows UX creativity
✔ Recruiters remember this
✔ Easily expandable to 3D later (Three.js)

🚀 Next level (if you want)

Tell me:

Are you already using Three.js / React Three Fiber?

Is your portfolio fullscreen canvas or normal React DOM?

I can:

Convert this to Three.js

Add cloth physics

Sync with page interactions (hover, click, load)

This idea is 🔥 — you’re thinking like a creative frontend dev, not just a coder.
